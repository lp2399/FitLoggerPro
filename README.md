# FitLoggerPro
In this project, we developed a comprehensive fitness application using React.js and Firebase, allowing users to log workouts, track weight, and monitor calorie and macronutrient intake. Leveraging libraries like Papaparse and Chart.js, we enhanced the app's functionality and user experience. Despite challenges with backend integration, our project showcases the effective use of modern technologies such as React.js, Node.js, npm, and Firebase in creating secure, user-friendly web applications.
