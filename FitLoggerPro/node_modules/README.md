# How to Install Node Modules

This guide will walk you through the steps to install `node_modules` for your Node.js project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Installing Node Modules

To install the `node_modules` required by your project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Run the following command to install the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file:

3. Wait for the installation process to complete. This may take a few minutes depending on the size of your project and the number of dependencies.

4. Once the installation is complete, you should see a new `node_modules` directory in your project's root directory. This directory contains all the modules required by your project.

That's it! You have successfully installed the `node_modules` for your project.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors during the installation process, make sure that you have the correct permissions to install modules globally, or try running the command with `sudo` privileges.
- If you're using a specific version of Node.js, make sure that the modules you're installing are compatible with that version. You can check the compatibility by looking at the `engines` field in your `package.json` file.
- If you're still having trouble, check the documentation for the specific modules you're trying to install or consult with the Node.js community for help.

That's all for now! Happy coding!
